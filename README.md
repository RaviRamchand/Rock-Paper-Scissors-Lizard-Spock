# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock 

This Java console program is a modification of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game by including a Lizard and Spock as shown in The Big Bang Theory. This game also has a scoreboard. If a user breaks the high score streak or the longest win streak, the scoreboard text file will update.
